Here is the command that I use to run shifter
the workdir needs to be someplace that is writeable as the wine stuff needs to write to it.
I think it has to be unique to each task.

shifter --volume=${workdir}:/mywineprefix --image=biocontainers/pwiz:phenomenal-v3.0.18205_cv1.2.54 mywine msconvert --32 --mzML ${rawfile}

we probably also want to add some options to msconvert
currently it is called with --32 --mzML
