# Cross reference table of the KEGG atom types in SMARTS notation
Here is a table with the the KEGG atom types in SMARTS notation.  Please let me know if there are mistakes.

The original paper describing the atom types is here
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja036030u
See Figure 1.

From this work:
The KEGG atom types are defined to make the best subgraphs. 68 atom types (node types) are defined for carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other atomic species with different environments, which has enabled detection of biochemically meaningful features.

They original atom types can be seen here:
